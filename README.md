<h1>Typescript Books</h1>

** This project was built with create-react-app. To run the app simply clone the repo and run ```npm install``` in the directory. All data is kept in state so no need to set up a database or connect to one. The user can create, update and delete the books in the list. <br /><br />
Its a list of some books I've enjoyed recently, if you'd like to add your own feel free to create a pull request or if you see any issues with the app please create a new issue.**
